# Faculty-Advisory-System
Faculty Advisory System is basically updating the manual process of registration into an internet based application so that a faculty member can directly register a student, of whom (s)he is a faculty advisor, for a course in case the student has no library or hostel dues. The project is specifically designed for the use of hostel staff, library staff, faculty members and students. The product will work as a complete user interface for registration process.
